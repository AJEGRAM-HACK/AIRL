# Milestone 1 verification

Verified on November 11, 2026 using Node.js 24.22.2 and npm.

## Passed

- `npm install`: installed dependencies; npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
- `npm run typecheck`: TypeScript strict checks passed.
- `npm run build`: production compilation, TypeScript, page generation and build traces passed using Webpack.
- `npm run start`: production server started at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
- HTTP smoke checks returned 200 and expected page content for `/`, `/watch/barangay-2099`, `/studio/barangay-2099`, `/universe/barangay-2099`.
- Unknown watch room, studio room and universe returned 404 with the custom error content.

## Environment recovery

- Node.js was absent from PATH. Downloaded the official Node 24 macOS ARM64 archive into `/tmp` and verified its SHA-256 against the official manifest.
- Network installation and local server access required sandbox escalation.
- Turbopack failed on an internal port binding even after an escalated retry. The standard Next.js Webpack path passed; project scripts explicitly use it for development and build.

## Verification limits

Computer-use inventory reported “browser access host is unavailable” and a native service startup failure. Browser screenshots, visual desktop/mobile checks, keyboard walkthroughs and client interaction tests could not be performed. HTTP checks verify server rendering, not browser interaction. The production server was stopped after checks.

No Supabase, OpenAI, Trigger.dev or Remotion calls were made. No real votes were recorded, no AI agents ran, and nothing was deployed or pushed. These are outside the approved milestone.
