# Milestone 1 verification

Verified on November 11, 2026 using Node.js 24.22.2 and npm.

## Passed

- `npm install`: installed dependencies; npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
- `npm run typecheck`: TypeScript strict checks passed.
- `npm run build`: production compilation, TypeScript, page generation and build traces passed using Webpack.
- `npm run start`: production server started at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
- HTTP smoke checks returned 200 and expected page content for `/`, `/watch/barangay-2099`, `/studio/barangay-2099`, `/universe/barangay-2099`.
- Unknown watch room, studio room and universe returned 404 with the custom error content.

## Environment recovery

- Node.js was absent from PATH. Downloaded the official Node 24 macOS ARM64 archive into `/tmp` and verified its SHA-256 against the official manifest.
- Network installation and local server access required sandbox escalation.
- Turbopack failed on an internal port binding even after an escalated retry. The standard Next.js Webpack path passed; project scripts explicitly use it for development and build.

## Verification limits

Computer-use inventory reported “browser access host is unavailable” and a native service startup failure. Browser screenshots, visual desktop/mobile checks, keyboard walkthroughs and client interaction tests could not be performed. HTTP checks verify server rendering, not browser interaction. The production server was stopped after checks.

No Supabase, OpenAI, Trigger.dev or Remotion calls were made. No real votes were recorded, no AI agents ran, and nothing was deployed or pushed. These are outside the approved milestone.

# Authorized local production slice — November 11, 2026

## Repository/environment inspection

Existing Milestone 1 code was preserved. The initial working tree was clean. Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zod, Lucide and UI utilities were already installed. OpenAI Agents SDK, Supabase, Trigger.dev and Remotion were not installed. Node 24.22.2 is present in the session's temporary runtime directory but not on the default shell PATH.

Only `.env.example` was present. OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, Supabase URL/keys and Trigger secret were absent from the process and no populated application environment file was found. Secret values were never displayed.

## Added and verified

- Installed pinned @openai/agents, openai, @next/env and tsx dependencies; npm reported zero vulnerabilities.
- Six production unit tests passed using explicit executor doubles: four-stage persistence across reopen, approved memory updates, bounded critic revisions, malformed output retries, manifest dialogue rejection, sanitized model-access failure and active-room locking.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Production server started; the four existing pages returned HTTP 200 and an invalid watch room returned HTTP 404.

## Live execution blocker

`npm run production -- "Launch a mandatory karaoke night"` exited with status 1 and the message “Configure OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_MODEL in .env.local. No API request was made.”

There is **no verified successful OpenAI connection, model inference, or four-agent episode**. Unit test artifacts were temporary test data and were removed; they are not production results. The command deliberately checks configuration before creating a production database or run. Once credentials are configured, a real run must complete and its database events and episode artifact must be inspected.

## Remaining boundaries

Persistence is local SQLite, not Supabase. The workflow is a CLI, not a durable Trigger.dev task. Existing studio statistics and the audience experience remain fixture-based; no real voting, browser-connected production progress, Remotion rendering, deployment or external push was introduced. Browser interaction QA was not repeated for this server-only slice. Character memory and episode continuity are tested locally but not evaluated against real model outputs.

# AIRL Phase 1 — November 11, 2026

- Preserved CinemAI route implementations, original art, episodes, character identities and production tests.
- Added AIRL homepage, discovery, module navigation, live room directory, sample room, studio entry, CinemAI-prefixed routes, PersonaAI directory and three profiles with scripted interactions.
- Moved shared character source data into PersonaAI and retained fixture re-exports for existing callers. Added structured character metadata and shared flags/tokens.
- Added typed demo and OpenAI creative providers. Demo is the default. Live requires configured credentials, model and explicit paid-call authorization. No live request was attempted.
- Nine tests passed. Three added tests verify deterministic, choice-sensitive output with network access replaced by a failing function, provider configuration rejection, manifest mismatch rejection and repeatable character responses. Existing six workflow tests continue passing.
- Strict TypeScript and production Webpack build passed.
- The real local demo CLI completed and persisted run `83eb0b5f-213e-4f8d-a59f-83f07dff2c23`, labeled demo with a validated three-scene manifest. It required no API credentials.
- Production HTTP checks passed for 15 route instances, including legacy CinemAI URLs and all three personas. Five invalid room/character/universe URLs returned 404.
- Browser inspection was attempted. The browser access host remains unavailable, so visual mobile/desktop QA and browser click/keyboard checks remain unverified.
- No new dependencies, services, paid calls, infrastructure provisioning, deployment or push were introduced. Phase 2 shared voting, participant identity, realtime, browser-connected job status and Remotion integration remain pending.
- Local data uses SQLite. The additive production mode migration preserves existing records. Public studio metrics remain labeled fixtures. Character interaction scripts do not save user conversations.
